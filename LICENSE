killersheep.nvim uses the Vim license, like the original Killersheep game by
Bram Moolenaar (https://github.com/vim/killersheep).

You can find the text here:
https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/doc/uganda.txt

It basically means you can copy the files as you like and also re-distribute
them, so long as you keep the license.
